You can represent this problem using a graph where each species of fish is a node, and the edges between nodes indicate whether the corresponding fish species can coexist or will fight. 
Graph coloring problem should be taken in consideration here,,, we want to assign colors (representing the tanks) to the nodes (fish species) in such a way that no adjacent nodes have the same color.

We will use an Undirected Graph here
If two species can coexist , there is an edge between their nodes,,, otherwise, there is no edge.
The UnDirected graph shows us that if there is an edge between two nodes,, then One specie will co-exist with the other specie and vice versa. SO there is no need to make a directed graph,, Undirected graph will serve the purpose
